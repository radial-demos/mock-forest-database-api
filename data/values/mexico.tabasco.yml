      <p>Tabasco us located in the southeast region of the country, bounded on
      the north by the Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic Ocean), on the east by Campeche 
      on the southeast by Guatemala, on the south by Chiapas and on the west by
      Veracruz.  According to the Political Constitution of Tabasco, the state
      is integrated by 17 municipalities, divided into two major regions and
      five subregions according to their geographical characteristics. In terms
      of area, Huimanguillo is the largest municipality and Paradise , the
      smallest; whereas according to the number of inhabitants, the most
      populated municipality is Centro and the least populated is Emiliano
      Zapata.<br />The state of Tabasco represents 1.26% of the country's area.
      By 2015, the state of Tabasco is divided into 17 municipalities. The 95.5%
      of the surface of the state presents warm humid climate, the remaining
      4.5% is subhumid climate toward the eastern part of the state. The average
      state rainfall is 2 550 mm annually, rainfall occurs throughout the year,
      being more abundant in the months of June to October.</p><p>The hot humid
      climate favors the cultivation of banana, papaya, orange, lemon, coconut,
      cocoa, rice, maize and pepper, among others. The state of Tabasco has a
      large area of natural pastures, which favors the exploitation of cattle
      through the system of free grazing or extensive livestock. Due to its
      hardiness and tolerance to high temperatures, Zebu cattle are best adapted
      to the tropical climate of the state.  Raising cattle is mainly aimed at
      obtaining meat, although there is also an important dairy production in
      the state.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a
