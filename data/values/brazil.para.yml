      <p>The state of Pará is the second largest Brazilian state in territorial
      extension, behind only the Amazon. It has approximately the same
      territorial extension as Portugal, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium,
      Holland and Denmark together. It is also the second largest state of the
      Legal Amazon in remaining forest area, with almost 900,000 km² of forests
      and an enormous biodiversity. </p><p>Pará is the state that perhaps best
      synthesizes the Amazon in the complex mosaic of activities that exist
      throughout the Region: vegetal extractivism, logging, large-scale
      monoculture, livestock, mining, highway opening, hydroelectric plants.
      Despite the history of strong economic and infrastructural activities over
      the forest areas, Pará has been progressively reducing its deforestation
      rates since 2009. </p><p>Part of the success in this reduction is due to
      public policies launched in the State. Pará has developed its Ecological
      and Economic Zoning (EEZ) plan, an essential environmental management tool
      for land use planning. In addition, the State also has the Plan for
      Prevention, Control and Alternatives to Deforestation (PPCAD), whose basic
      premise is that only Command and Control actions are not enough for the
      State, only the creation of sustainable economic alternatives is capable
      of perpetuating reduction of deforestation rates and contribute to the
      maintenance of forest blocks. </p><p>Believing that it is possible to grow
      economically without having to reproduce the historical model of
      environmental degradation, the State develops the Green Municipalities
      Program, which reinforces the existing public policies by being a great
      pact in the search for an economy model that combines conservation and
      production and guarantee Pará a low carbon economy. From a pact between
      Public Power, Productive Sector and Civil Society, production increases,
      adapts to legality, becomes sustainable and brings improvements to the
      quality of life of the people of Pará. </p><p>The Government of the State
      of Pará understands that there is still a long way to go and continues to
      move towards regulatory frameworks and public policies for Climate Change
      and Environmental Services. An example of this is the reopening of the
      Para Forum of Climate Change, in process. </p><p>Although the State does
      not have a specific regulatory framework for Climate Change, Environmental
      Services and REDD +, several REDD + projects in the state are in the
      design and development phase, some of which are in partnership with NGOs
      such as Imazon, Conservation International and TNC. </p><p>Additional

      <p>The major drivers of deforestation are cattle ranching, large-scale
      agriculture, and logging; relatively more minor drivers include mining,
      urban areas, and infrastructure (e.g., dams). Large cattle ranches account
      for 60% of all deforestation, whereas smallholder lands account for
      another 30%. Four percent of deforested area is associated with logging
      and 3% only is directly associated with professional and high productivity
      agriculture.</p><p>Pará and Mato Grosso have the highest deforestation
      rates in the Brazilian Amazon, accounting for 68% of total deforestation
      (Mato Grosso, 35%; Pará, 33%). Both states have drastically reduced
      deforestation in the last 6 years. In Pará, deforestation has consistently
      decreased since its highest point in 2005 (8870 km²), declining by more
      than 50% to 4281 km² in 2009. The reduction is attributed to an increase
      in the enforcement and control measures.</p>

            enrolled in the CAR<br>2. Do not have deforestation after July 22,

            the areas embargoed by SEMAS (LDI);<br>5. Do not have overlaps with
            Indigenous Lands or with Conservation Units, except APAs;<br>6. Not

            Licensing for properties over 3,000 hectares;<br>To date, two
            independent audits have been carried out and the third is ongoing.
            This control is necessary to verify the degree of compliance of the
            agreement between the parties and to improve it, thus guaranteeing
            the effectiveness of the instrument, reducing deforestation related

            the Federal Public Ministry, Ibama and Para Seceretary of

            implementation of mandatory replanting and reforestation projects to
            guarantee the sustainable supply of charcoal for its activities,
            thereby reducing deforestation caused by the demand for charcoal
            extracted from native forests. It also provides for the recovery of
            deforested areas without authorization by companies, which will
            contribute to carbon sequestration and other environmental services.
            In relation to environmental liabilities, it is foreseen than
            45,000,000 hectares will be reforested with native species in eight
            to twelve years. In addition, companies must pay compensation for
            the environmental damage already caused and the resources can be
            used for environmental and social projects, as the agreement also
            involves improving working conditions in coal production.</p>

            throughout the state to obtain the current mapping of the forest and
            its deforestation, subsidizing effective deforestation control and
            enforcement actions. Using high-resolution images from Planet
            satellites, images from the territory of Pará are made available
            every 3 days. The platform allows for easy visualization and
            analysis of the areas of deforestation, allowing for rapid analysis
            overlayed with geospatial information such as Forest Management
            Areas, Licensed Areas, CAR (Area of Property, Legal Reserve, APP),
            Conservation Unit, or any area of interest. The platform allows the
            generation of specific reports and the sending of both alerts and
            legal notifications. Printed reports show mapped areas and the
            amount of deforestation, including all the information generated by
            the processed image processing. Through the project every citizen
            can monitor the forest monitoring and alerts of evidence of
            deforestation, participating in and contributing to the maintenance
            and recovery of the forest. The Project is available on the SEMAS

            increase of 85% of the salary mass.</p><p>iii. Up to 80% reduction
            of emissions of effect gases studies per unit of GDP.</p><p>iv.
            Priority projects carried out and quality of 100% of the road
