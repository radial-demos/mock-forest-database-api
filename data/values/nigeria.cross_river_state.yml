      <p>Over 90 per cent of Nigeria’s forests have already been cleared, and
      more than 50% of forested areas that remain in the country are found in
      Cross River State. Approximately 75% of Nigeria’s endangered tree species
      are only found in Cross River State. The State is considered one of the
      richest biodiversity reserves in all of Africa and is part of the “Gulf of
      Guinea” forests, a global biodiversity hotspot, with a rich diversity of
      primates, birds, butterflies, plants, reptiles, amphibians and other
      species. </p><p>Cross River's forests support 22 primate species,
      including endemics like the Cross River Gorilla, Drill monkey, and
      Preuss's Guenon monkey.</p><p>Cross River State has taken many steps to
      protect its forests, including the following: <br />1. Holding a
      Stakeholders Summit on the Environment in June 2008; <br />2. Enacting a
      two-year logging moratorium; <br />3. Establishing and supporting an
      anti-logging task force to enforce the moratorium, with approximately
      USD$1 million committed to this cause;<br />4. Implementing far-reaching
      reforms in the Cross River State Forestry Commission; and<br />5.
      Committing to plant 5 million indigenous trees annually, with the
      development of nurseries in progress across the state.</p><p>Within 10
      years, Cross River State plans to have 1 million hectares of forest lands
      managed for climate change-friendly activities, including carbon,
      non-timber forest products, sustainable tree crops and ecotourism. This
      could generate substantial economic value for the state.</p>

      <p><strong>The main (direct) drivers of deforestation in Cross River State
      include</strong>:Commercial agriculture, subsistence agriculture,
      Logging/timber extraction Mining, Fuel wood extraction practices dominate
      the list of deforestation drivers. </p><p><strong>Indirect causes of
      deforestation in Nigeria</strong><br />The underlying causes of
      deforestation and forest degradation can be grouped under macro economic
      factors, governance factors and other factors (including demographic
      technological and cultural factors).</p><p><strong>Macro economic
      factors</strong><br />The higher profitability of agriculture is the main
      economic factor underlying the conversion of forests to other uses. Other
      macro economic factors include external debt; foreign exchange rate policy
      and trade policies governing the sector. For example, the ban on log and
      sawn timber export has contributed significantly to this inefficiency by
      keeping prices lower than their true competitive levels. This has
      continued to protect the inefficiency of the wood industry. According to a
      World Bank study’s analysis, four states (for which complete data are
      available) subsidized the forest industry to the tune of US $6.5 million
      in 2003 through a failure to adjust their fees to their real levels and a
      failure to capture revenues lost through illegal logging. This study
      estimated that between 2001 and 2003, the four states lost US $ 18.7
      million from these sources.</p><p><strong>Governance factors</strong><br
      />Deforestation and degradation can result from the combined impact of
      poor forest tenure arrangements and weak forestry institutions, which in
      turn determine the set of incentives that leads to
      overexploitation.</p><p><strong>Outdated forest laws</strong>: The
      legislative structure for forest management in Nigeria has remained
      largely unchanged since colonial times. Forest resources fall under three
      main categories: Forest Reserves, State and private tree plantations, and
      ‘free areas’. The colonial legislation set a number of precedents that are
      still evident today, including a policy thrust based upon the expansion of
      reserved areas and plantations, in which communities have very limited
      rights. The current National Forest Policy (1988), 11 continues this trend
      by focusing on achieving national self-sufficiency in wood production and
      a doubling of the reserved forest area. However, the status quo appears to
      have continued largely unchanged by this policy environment. The role of
      rural communities in forest management and the importance of forest
      resources to the rural poor have not been recognized so
      far.</p><p><strong>No integration with other ministries</strong>:
      Government agricultural programmes, and the potential expansion of the
      solid minerals sector, have a significant impact on forestry in Nigeria,
      with this largely being overlooked in national planning processes.
      Forestry and the environment in general, is not effectively integrated
      across national planning, despite the presence of mainstreaming mechanisms
      (such as the inactive biodiversity inter-ministerial
      committee).</p><p><strong>Land tenure</strong>: Land tenure laws fail to
      formally recognize community tenure of land removing an incentive for
      villages to manage their land resources more effectively. The rights of
      communities over the forest sector worsened following the Land Use Decree
      of 1978.</p><p><strong>Weak capacity at Federal level</strong>: The
      management of forest resources and the right to generate revenue from the
      forest estate are both vested in the State Governments at present. The
      1978 Land Use Decree, which vests all land in the hands of the State
      Governors, strengthened this mandate. The role of the Federal Government
      appears somewhat limited, although the Federal Department of Forestry
      (FDF) holds the remit to advance national forest policy. The FDF is in a
      weak position, having suffered from a lack of capacity development over
      last fifteen years. The National Forest Development Committee (NFDC) is
      the forum that brings together all the State Forestry Directors and is
      chaired by the Director of the FDF. It provides an important institutional
      link between the Federal authority and the States. In recent times it has
      been involved in guiding forest policy and legislation
      development.</p><p><strong>Weak capacity at state level</strong>: This
      lack of capacity and funding situation is reflected at the state level,
      where the State Forestry Departments lack capacity to manage forests
      effectively. On the other hand, forestry plays a pivotal role in State
      finances for example, in Ekiti State, with 40 % of Internally Generated
      Revenue being raised from timber royalties and license fees in 2002.
      Nevertheless, the funding of government agencies remains weak and there is
      very limited civil society capacity to compensate for this
      deficiency.</p><p>Absence of forest management planning: An important
      cause for deforestation within the forest reserves can be linked to state
      forestry departments who have abandoned any form of forest management for
      natural forest since the 1970s. As a result, reserve forests are being
      treated as an infinite resource with no effective policies in place to
      regulate their harvesting. An example of this is the practice of
      allocating short-term concession of 1 to 3 years that encourage annual
      re-entries thereby totally degrading the forests. In many reserves
      management amounts to salvage logging for the last remaining
      trees.</p><p><strong>High revenue targets and low timber fees</strong>:
      The forest revenue system of the states has also contributed to the
      forests’ demise. The allocation of concessions is by discretion and annual
      timber removal is driven by the states’ revenue targets. These are set
      administratively without regard to what actually exists in the forest or
      what can be sustainable harvested. A World Bank Forestry Economic Study
      for Nigeria in year 2005 showed that low timber fees have had a direct
      impact on the efficiency of forest industry, costing the state significant
      losses in revenue as well as causing wastage of valuable timber resources.
      Other reasons for degradation in the forest reserves include inefficient
      wood-utilization by industry and, therefore, a higher demand for
      industrial grade timber, and illegal logging.</p><p><strong>De-reservation
      by state governments</strong>: In addition, forest estates are being
      de-reserved by some state Governments and the State Forest Departments who
      have been resist the spate of requests from corporate and influential
      individuals for excisions from the forest estate for the establishment of
      agricultural cropland. The unfortunate impression has thus been created
      that the forest estate exists as a land bank as the demands for
      de-reservation continue nationwide.</p><p><strong>Ban on wood
      export</strong>: In addition, the ban on log and sawn timber export has
      contributed significantly to this inefficiency by keeping prices lower
      than their true competitive levels. This has continued to protect the
      inefficiency of the wood industry. According to this World Bank study’s
      analysis, four states (for which complete data are available) subsidized
      the forest industry to the tune of US $6.5 million in 2003 through a
      failure to adjust their fees to their real levels and a failure to capture
      revenues lost through illegal logging. This study estimated that between
      2001 and 2003, the four states lost US $ 18.7 million from these
      sources.</p><p><strong>Demographic factors</strong><br />A growing rural
      population and migration to the agricultural frontier increases the
      pressure on forests. An increasing population in urban and rural areas
      also raises the demand for food and other land-based commodities, thus,
      requiring more land to produce them.</p><p><strong>Technological
      factors</strong><br />Technological improvements can affect deforestation
      rates. The adoption of land extensive technologies inevitably results in
      the expansion of agriculture at the expense of
      forests.</p><p><strong>Cultural factors</strong><br />Sacred groves and
      forest areas are often protected from land conversion and degradation.
      However, other cultural factors exert pressure on forests. The majorities
      of forest communities with a few exceptions is unaware of any alternatives
      to unsustainable exploitation and are often divided amongst themselves as
      to how to best exploit the forests for their development. In a typical
      village individuals supported by logging interests are often pitted
      against hunters and NTFP collectors. Chiefs are often compromised by
      loggers and are unable to protect the forests for the good of the majority
      in the village who may depend on NTFPs and bush meat and other forest
      products to supplement farming income. Divided communities are often far
      more vulnerable to predatory logging interests and so within a few
      generations, their forests are cleared while the villages remain poor.</p>

            moratorium has been in force, following the government’s institution
            of an Anti-deforestation Task Force that has been used to ensure
            compliance.On assumption of office, the Government of Cross River
            State, established a whole new Ministry of Climate Change and
            Forestry to properly deal with the issue of climate change
            mitigation and adaptation. The Ministry so established was given the
            mandate to plant five million trees yearly across the State. The
            Government also engaged 1,000 youths into the Green Sheriff
            Volunteer Scheme to aggressively combat deforestation. In 2016, the
            Carbon Emissions Board was established to monitor and regulate
            emissions within the State.</p>

            seeks to restore the displaced Bakassi indigenes to their original
            habitat and occupation of fishing and tidal fish-farming. The
            project has an estimated cost of about $200,000,000.00 and is funded
            by the Africa Nations Development Programme, ANDP, in partnership
            with the Cross River State Government. The 5,000 housing units is
            being constructed in Ikpa Nkanya village, Akpabuyo Local Government
            Area of the State, and will benefit the Bakassi refugees who are
            predominantly fishermen by occupation, thus protecting their rights
            and livelihoods.</p>
