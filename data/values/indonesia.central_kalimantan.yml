      <p>Spanning across 153,564 km2, Central Kalimantan is Indonesia’s third
      largest province and has 13 districts and 1 city, 129 subdistricts, 136
      kelurahan, 1,344 villages and 67 Kademangan (Note: kelurahan and villages
      are basically two identical local levels of government, the former is used
      in cities, the latter is used in rural areas). The Province of Central
      Kalimantan became Indonesia’s fifth full member of the GCF in 2010. It
      occupies an area of 153,564 km with just 2.2 million people, resulting in
      very low population density. The capital of the Province is Palangkaraya.
      There are 13 local government Districts and 1500 urban and rural villages.
      Overall 67% of the population live in rural areas, where villages tend to
      be distributed along the banks of the 11 large rivers which flow from the
      central mountains to the Java Sea. The largest ethnic group are the
      indigenous Dayaks, but there are significant numbers of official and
      economic migrants from Java, Bali and Sulawesi in both rural and urban
      settlements. Poverty remains a major issue particularly in rural areas
      because of the difficulty and cost of transport and communication and the
      impact that this has on basic human services delivery. Education and
      health services in the hinterland are poor and this is reflected in their
      Human Development Index (HDI).</p><p>Despite the low population, Central
      Kalimantan has suffered serious and widespread environmental degradation.
      From 1996 to 1999 it was the sight of the so-called mega rice project
      which impacted one million hectares of peat swamp forests which were
      cleared and 4000 km of canals constructed. The continuing legacy of this
      period has been the draining of the peats in the dry season leading to
      high emissions of GHG’s through oxidation and through annual dry season
      fires. Central Kalimantan has about 3 million hectares of Peat soils,
      equaling West, East and South Kalimantan combined. The extent of the
      impact of the clearing of the swamp forests for agriculture and estate
      crops can be appreciated from the forest figures which show only 865,000
      hectares of remaining swamp forest compared to 1.4 million hectares of
      secondary forest and a further 1.1 million hectares of degraded shrubland.
      Of the original area of peat, 80% is subject to the danger of seasonal
      fire or oxidation. Restoration of the damaged peat ecosystems is a high
      priority of the Provincial Government and is also identified as a priority
      through Presidential Instruction.</p><p>Management of the remaining
      forests in Central Kalimantan is subject to continuing discussion and
      planning. 12.6 million hectares remains within the national forest estate
      with a further 2.8 million in other land use categories. Negotiations are
      continuing to firm up the zoning of the forest land, but proposed changes
      have greatly increased the proportion within the Protection Forest
      category where its role in hydrologic regulation and reduced soil carbon
      emissions is regarded as critical. Central Kalimantan has been pursuing a
      low carbon development strategy in line with national policies. In 2010,
      Central Kalimantan was chosen to serve as a pilot Province for REDD+
      development following the LOI between Norway and Indonesia. In 2005 it
      established a “green” policy framework which evolved in 2010 to a vision
      of Central Kalimantan as a “Green and Clean Province”.  The province is
      the site for the Australia-Indonesia Forest Carbon Partnership REDD+
      Demonstration Project which aims to reduce emissions on 135 000 hectares
      of degraded peatlands. It also hosts a number of other private investment
      REDD+ Projects and is a participant in the Heart of Borneo trans-boundary
      conservation project.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

      <p>The deforestation rate in Indonesia reaches 1.17 million hectares
      annually with 64.8% of deforestation occurring in forest areas and 35.2%
      in non-forest areas (APL).</p><p>The rate in the province stands at 63.1
      thousand hectares annually, with nearly all deforestation occurring in
      forest areas (99.8% vs. 0.2% in non-forest areas). ) The deforestation has
      been increasing the emission of CO2 and NH4, two of the main greenhouse
      gases) .
      (http://borneonews.co.id/news/kotawaringin-barat/12-kobar/11662-laju-deforestasi-di-kalteng-631-hektare-per-tahun.html)</p><p>Monitoring
      methodologies and accuracy</p><p>On 5 January 2012, a new regulation was
      issued concerning the island-wide spatial plan, i.e. President’s Decree
      No. 3 of 2012 on Kalimantan Island’s Spatial Plan. It stipulates that the
      minimum size of conservation areas and vegetated protected areas to be
      protected is 45% of the island’s total area. It also supports
      rehabilitation of degraded forests, including ex-mining areas, and aims at
      making the island the world’s lung.</p><p>The regulation, however,
      abolishes Limited Production Forests in State’s Forest, entailing a more
      serious threat of deforestation to the province, as suggested by Forest
      Watch Indonesia (FWI) and Telapak after analyzing Appendix 2 of the
      Regulation. These forest monitoring NGOs found “a loss of 3.32 million
      hectares of forest”, which had previously been categorized as Limited
      Production Forest. Although the area is as not wholly forested, most of it
      is natural forest.</p><p>In its Portrait of Indonesia’s Forests report,
      released in July 2011, FWI reported that Central Kalimantan had the
      highest deforestation rate in Indonesia. The province had at least lost
      about 2 million hectares of forest during 2000 through 2009. The
      deforestation occurred in almost all forest ecosystem types, including 490
      thousand hectares of forest in peatland. (http://fwi.or.id/?p=335)</p>
