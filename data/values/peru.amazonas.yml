      <p>While the Region of Amazonas has historically low rates of
      deforestation, it is facing but several challenges in the management of
      their forests.  The tegion is home to a number of indigenous communities 
      (including the awajun and wampis) who depend on forest and ecosystem
      services to sustain their livelihoods.</p><p>Amazonas has taken  steps to
      improve the management of its forests through the creation of a Regional
      Environmental Authority and the implementation of a Regional Conservation
      System. However, there are pending challenges such as designing a
      jurisdictional forest conservation strategy, improving management for
      sustainable use of forest resources (especially indigenous community
      forests),and increasing funding to support these
      initiatives.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the<a

            Peru, the 3FI initiative is led by the Earth Innovation Institute
            and the Amazon Regional Council (CIAM, in Spanish) and is developing
            incentives for low-emission rural development under a production and
            protection approach. The activities of 3FI in the Peruvian Amazon
            are led by the regional governments and are open to the
            participation of any public or private institution that wishes to
            contribute. 3FI considers with special attention the participation
            of indigenous peoples and women in the activities to be carried out.
            The initiative is based on empowering the progress of each region to
            make the necessary incentives proposals by building tailored
            instruments for each jurisdiction. Output from the project include:
            (a) developing regional plans or roadmaps to promote a transition to
            low-emission rural development; (b) promoting a transparent dialogue
            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of
            indigenous peoples and women; and (c) developing a business plan to
            attract private investment and promote low-emission rural
            development in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>

            organizations representing indigenous peoples. The coalition has
            established an agenda to promote development amazon focused on: i)
            ensuring land rights and forest native communities and agricultural
            and forestry producers; ii) optimizing the sustainable use of forest
            landscapes in the Amazon; iii) building the set of enabling
            conditions and generate the necessary changes for rural development
            low emission. Goals of the coalition include reducing deforestation
            associated with agriculture, creating roadmaps for public - private
            coordination by Amazon region, designing an architecture of
            financing, increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and
            increasing the value of forests and promote forest plantations. It
            is expected that these measures will open a pathway to build
            sustainable jurisdictions, especially in the value chains of the
            Amazon through a Production - Protection approach. A group of
            companies from the Pro Ucayali network, comprising the largest
            companies in the region, have joined the coalition.</p>
