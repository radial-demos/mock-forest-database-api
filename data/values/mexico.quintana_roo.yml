      <p>The state of Quintana Roo is located in the eastern portion of the
      Mexican Republic, with its boundary to the east with the Caribbean Sea and
      to the north with the Gulf of Mexico and the state of Yucatan, to the west
      it borders the state of Campeche and to the south with Belize and
      Guatemala along a border of just over 180 km. The territorial extension is
      of approximately 5 million hectares occupying the 19th place in
      territorial extension in Mexico, although there is a territorial dispute
      with Campeche for little more than 1/2 million hectares. The state has
      approximately 1000 km of coastline and 10 municipalities. Of the little
      more than 5 million hectares of state territory, about 4,160,000 ha are
      currently covered by dense vegetation</p><p>The three states in Yucatán
      Peninsula (Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán) share certain similar
      ecological and social characteristics, which enable certain dynamics to be
      analyzed jointly. In Yucatán Peninsula, most of the natural forest is
      tropical (mainly mid-height and lowland, with very few areas<br />of
      mountain forest) and parts of this area are tall grassland (secondary or
      replacement forest, which forms part of a long rotation of the milpa
      crop-growing system).<br />There are currently different estimations of
      the assessment of deforestation rates due to the different definitions of
      forest, methods, time periods studied and scales of analysis (Rueda,
      2010), and most studies focus on the loss and partial recovery of forest
      cover, paying particular attention to the regions in the center and south
      of the Peninsula (Turner et al., 2004; Bray and Klepeis, 2005; Vester et
      al., 2007; Ellis and Porter-Bolland, 2008), probably related to the fact
      that this part of the Peninsula is designated a biological corridor.<br
      />For the period from 1993 to 2002, the predominant process in  Quintana
      Roo was the degradation of evergreen tropical forests.  Quintana Roo
      recorded a higher rate of degradation than deforestation; one important
      difference in the state is that between 2002 and 2007 there was a major
      trend of change to human settlements and infrastructure, which was an
      important factor in deforestation. </p><p>More information can be found on

            Yucatan Peninsula Framework Agreement on Sustainability for 2030

            <p>At COP 13 of the Conventions on Biodiversity held in Cancun in
            2016, Quintana Roo, the Governments of the Yucatan Peninsula signed
            a collaborative work plan for 2030 called "Agreement for
            Sustainability of the Yucatan Peninsula" (ASPY 2030). This agreement
            strengthens collaboration among subnational governments to
            facilitate transition and compliance with the Paris Agreement, the
            Bonn Challenge, Rio Branco Declaration and the Aichi Goals among
            others. The implementation of the ASPY 2030 will occur through the
            Regional Climate Change Commission, formed through the first
            regional agreement on climate change signed at COP16 in 2010, and
            supported by NGO initiatives such as the Mayan Forest Observatory
            which generate inputs for forest policy. ASPY 2030 covers 8
            components, each with specific lines of
            action:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>sustainable agricultural
            development,&nbsp;</li><li>effective forest
            management,&nbsp;</li><li>ecosystem
            conservation,&nbsp;</li><li>water and
            ecosystems,&nbsp;</li><li>sustainable coastal

            and responsible market development, and&nbsp;</li><li>sustainable
            tourism&nbsp;</li></ul><p>ASPY is also supported by a Declaration of
            the Private and Financial Sector, in which 70 companies of great
            impact in the region have expressed their interest in contributing
            social and environmental responsibility towards corporate
            sustainability, which will contribute strongly to achieving the
            goals of the Agreement of Governors of the Yucatan Peninsula, ASPY
            2030. The Governors of ASPY 2030 are: Mr. Rolando Zapata Bello,
            Governor of Yucatan, Mexico; Lic. Carlos Joaquín González, Governor
            of Quintana Roo, Mexico and Lic. Rafael Alejandro Moreno Cárdenas,

            Carbon Fund, in coordination with CONAFOR. This fund started
            operations in December 2016, in phase 1, developing the executive
            plan to implement the trust, coordinating the operational strategy
            of the Advisory Council, designing the fundraising plan and the
