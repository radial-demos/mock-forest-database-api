      <p>Nationally the forest Code (1978) creates two types of forest land in
      Ivory coast: Permanent Forest Domain of the State and the Rural Forest
      Domain of the State. While there is no central spatial or land use plan
      for the entire country,  19% of the country is designated as permanent
      forest domain (including gazetted forests and protected ).  Rural forest
      domain is estimated to cover 2-3 million hectares.</p>
