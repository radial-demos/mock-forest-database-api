      <p>Tocantins is the most recent state in the twenty-seven states of
      Brazil, having been created in 1988. With 22% of its protected area in
      protected areas or indigenous lands (equivalent to about 62,000 km²),
      Tocantins is a State with great relevance in the national and
      international context due to the natural resources and the
      sociobiodiversity that it harbors. Two biomes are present, the Cerrado
      biome, with greater predominance in terms of the occupied area, and the
      Amazon biome, as well as transition zones between biomes (Cerrado-Amazon
      ecotone and Cerrado-Caatinga ecotone). Economically, the agricultural
      sector is the most relevant sector, with emphasis on the production of
      soybeans and meat and its derivatives. According to data from CONAB -
      Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (March 2013), it is estimated that the
      soybean harvest in Tocantins in 2012/2013 has a record increase compared
      to the previous harvest, with an expected growth of the area cultivated in
      about 20% to 543 thousand hectares, and a production of 1,657 thousand
      tons, the largest in the North Region. </p><p>Regarding the existence of
      regulatory frameworks in the areas of Climate Change, REDD + or
      Environmental Services, Tocantins pioneered the establishment of a State
      Policy on Climate Change, published in 2008. Currently, this Policy on
      Climate Change, Conservation (Law No. 1,917 / 2008) is in the process of
      being reformulated to accommodate recent national and international
      developments in the field of climate, including REDD +. The State Plan for
      Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change is also in the initial stage
      of elaboration, as well as the State Policy on Environmental Services, the
      latter aiming to define the guidelines for encouraging biodiversity
      conservation and services provided through ecosystem services, notably
      through Environmental Services Payment Programs and other conservation
      incentive strategies. </p><p>The Secretariat for the Environment and
      Sustainable Development of Tocantins has a Climate Change Coordination and
      an Environmental Services Payment Coordination, which demonstrates efforts
      to create robust regulatory frameworks in both areas. The State also
      reactivated the State Forum on Climate Change in 2012 (through Decree-Law
      no. 4,550), which is composed of governmental and non-governmental
      representatives, whose objective is to raise awareness and foment public
      discussion on issues related to change climate, energy, biodiversity,
      forests and ecosystem services and REDD +. </p><p>In addition to having
      specific legislation on Climate Change in the process of revision and
      developing a regulatory framework in the area of environmental services,
      the State of Tocantins has a great legal tool that provides for actions to
      reduce illegal deforestation and degradation forestry: the Plan of
      Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Burnings of Tocantins - PPCDQ
      / TO, published in May 2009, revised in 2015, and under consultation for a
      further revision in 2017 or 2018. This plan aims to contain illegal
      deforestation and forest fires through integrated actions in four areas of
      action: monitoring, territorial and landscape management, forest
      management and promotion of sustainable production practices. Among the 23
      targets of the PPCDAM-TO, the reduction of illegal deforestation rates to
      zero within five years stands out; the reduction of 15% per year of fire
      outbreaks in the municipalities with the highest incidence; the promotion
      of environmental regularization, the improvement of annual monitoring
      routines and the implementation of the environmental register of rural
      properties (CAR). </p><p>In addition to these policies, Tocantins is
      committed to developing a State Plan for Reducing GHG Emissions and
      Adapting to Climate Change.<br />Tocantins will make every effort to
      elaborate a plan that will have as objectives (i)<br />to make an
      inventory of GHG emissions in each sector, (ii) identify possible
      actions<br />reduction, mitigation and compensation (iii) strengthen
      municipalities and<br />decentralization of actions, thus ensuring the
      promotion of a low-income economy.<br />carbon. The Plan will be in force
      until 2020.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

      created in 2009 and outlines a action-oriented action plan for the
      prevention and control of deforestation and forest fires in the State. The
      Plan serves not only the Amazon biome, which covers a relatively small
      part of the State, but also the Cerrado biome, covering all the state
      territory and providing a plan of action for better forest management and
      a reduction of deforestation rates and of the use of fire in an integrated
      manner. To achieve this, the PPCDQ-TO has a total of 12 actions, divided
      into four main areas: (i) monitoring; (ii) land and landscape management;
      (iii) forest management; and (iv) promotion of productive
      alternatives.</p><p>These are specific objectives of the
      Plan:</p><ul><li>To strengthen the capacity of the State to analyze the

      resources in the State through the improvement of technologies and
      procedures.</li><li>Foster sustainable production alternatives and
      practices.</li></ul><p>In the PPCDQ-TO, 23 goals were defined, and the
      coordination of the Plan involves federal and state public institutions
      and private institutions, while the implementation of the actions is in
      charge of the Nature Institute of Tocantins - NATURATINS (actions of the
      areas of monitoring and management forestry), the State Secretariat for

      <p>Ecological and Economic Zoning (<em>Zoneamento Ecológico-Econômico –
      </em><em>ZEE)</em> is required by the Federal Government to designate
      areas for economic and conservation activities within each state’s
      territory. Tocantins carried out ecological-ecological zoning (EEZ) in the
      <a
      href="http://gcftaskforce-database.org/assets/downloads/GCFF/database/Tocantins%20-%20ZEE%20Norte.pdf">Northern
      Region of the State</a>, comprising 37 communes, covering an area of
      approximately 34,000 km², encompassing areas of the Amazon Forest and
      Cerrado, as well as the transition between these two ecomes (ecotone). The
      Northern Region EEZ was developed with the support of the Natural
      Resources Policy Subprogram (SPRN) of the Pilot Program for the
      Conservation of Brazilian Tropical Forests (PPG7). Five zones and four
      ecological and economic subzones were defined: Areas for Human Occupation
      (Zone A); Areas for Environmental Conservation and Cultural Heritage (Zone
      B); Priority Areas for Comprehensive Protection Areas (Zone C); Areas of
      Conservation Units of Sustainable Use (Zone D); and Areas under Federal

      the EEZ for the whole territory of the State, as part of the World
      Bank-financed Integrated Regional Sustainable Development Program (PDRIS).
      The zoning should identify more precisely the areas with the best
      suitability for agriculture and the key areas for biodiversity
      conservation and the production of environmental services.</p>

      <p>The safeguards to be designed by the state of Tocantins in a future
      REDD + scheme will aim to minimize the occurrence of socio-environmental
      risks of defined policies and activities associated with REDD +, such as
      the non-involvement or lack of involvement of forest peoples in the
      construction of projects of REDD (and in the construction of the legal
      framework of REDD + at the state level, considering its traditional
      knowledge and its forms of interaction with the forest) and the
      non-directed distribution of benefits to those who are effectively
      responsible for forest conservation. The promotion of forest conservation
      through future REDD + projects should also include the identification of
      biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services associated with forest
      preservation. All the documentation generated in the scope of national and
      international discussion groups on the subject will be consulted and a
      discussion will be carried out at the state level to focus on the
      particularities of the State of Tocantins.</p><p>Studies are currently
      being proposed to identify and evaluate the ecosystem services associated
      with conservation units of integral protection of the State (project to be

      ecosystem services to be promoted together with the reduction of emissions
      from deforestation and forest degradation.</p>

      <p>The most recent deforestation in the state of Tocantins has been
      occurring: </p><p>1) in the vicinity of the intensive and semi-intensive
      agricultural production zone in the Papagaio Bico (North Tocantins);
      </p><p>2) around the northwest region of the state, for the production of
      beef cattle by small and medium-sized producers; </p><p>3) around the
      central belt, along the BR 153 highway, as a result of the competition
      between the different uses and the intensification process; </p><p>4) in
      the extreme northeast and east of the state under pressure from the
      soybean fronts in Bahia and Maranhão; </p><p>5) along BR010, TO 050 and
      marginal and isolated areas; </p><p>6) in the Southeast and Northeast of
      the State for the production of charcoal. </p><p>In summary, the main
      drivers of deforestation are: the expansion of agriculture, the lack of
      land-use planning caused by squatting of public lands by squatters,
      livestock and infrastructure works, especially roads. </p>

            <p>The Cerrado-Jalapão Project aims at the prevention, control and
            monitoring of fires in the Cerrado and contributes to the
            maintenance of the Cerrado as a carbon sink of global relevance for
            the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and for the conservation
            biodiversity by improving the integrated and adaptive management of
            fire in selected areas of the Cerrado. The project has already
            produced and published documents on alternatives to fire use,
            participatory management of PAs and terms of engagement,monitoring,
            fire research, operational plans and protection plans, seminars and

            <p>Within the PDRIS a number of projects are being developed, some
            of which fall under the categories of the Balikpapan
            Challenge:</p><p>• REDD + Jurisdictional Program: This initiative,
            which is still in the development phase, means that isolated REDD+
            projects are integrated to a jurisdictional level, allowing a
            greater alignment with national policies and legislation. In
            addition, it aims to ensure that emission reductions scale to a
            jurisdictional level and can be inserted into a registration system,
            which in turn will promote a fair distribution of benefits and
            enable the implementation of socio-environmental safeguards;</p><p>•
            The elaboration of the State Policy for the Sustainable Use of
            Capim-Dourado and Buriti was finalized, whose objective is to
            promote the socioeconomic development of traditional communities
            that historically make handicrafts of Capim-Dourado and Buriti by
            means of the incentive to sustainable practices of use of these two
            species and their environments;</p><p>• Tocantins is finalizing its
            legal framework, the draft Law that establishes the State Policy on
            Climate Change and Environmental Services of Tocantins, with the
            general objective of promoting the regional economy with low
            emission of greenhouse gases and encouraging and promote
            environmental services in the biomes of the State;</p><p>•
            Environmental Monitoring and Fire Management Center (CeMAF) -
            Through a Term of Cooperation, the Secretariat of Environment and
            Water Resources (SEMARH) and the Federal University of Tocantins
            (UFT) promote the mutual conjugation of efforts to carry out the
            activities technical and research related to the implementation of
            CeMAF. The Center works in the production of studies, technical and
            scientific information, mainly related to burned forest fires, which
            subsidize the actions of the state, municipal and other public
            authorities through mutual collaboration in the evaluation of
            regulatory mechanisms and development of new technical instruments
            to improve environmental management. The partnership also involves
            the training of managers and technical experts in order to improve
            the efficiency of public management, especially related to
            conservation activities and the sustainable use of natural
            resources. CeMAF is located on the UFT campus in the city of
            Gurupi.</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"
