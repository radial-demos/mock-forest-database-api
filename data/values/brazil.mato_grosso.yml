      <p>The state of Mato Grosso is located in the Central-West region of
      Brazil, bordering the states of Pará and Amazonas to the north, Mato
      Grosso do Sul to the south, Goiás and Tocantins to the East and Rondônia
      and Bolivia to the West. It is the third largest state in the country by
      area, with an area of 903,000 square kilometers and a population of three
      million, two hundred thousand inhabitants. The state territory is composed
      of three biomes: Pantanal, Cerrado and Amazon. It contains a considerable
      number of protected areas, divided into 70 indigenous lands, 23 federal
      conservation units, 46 state conservation units and 35 municipal
      conservation units. In the three biomes, it is possible to find different
      types of vegetation, as the plant physiognomy varies from forest fragments
      to meadows, with great variation in their carbon stocks.<br /><br />The
      state of Mato Grosso is one of the main producers of agricultural products
      in Brazil, including soybeans, corn, beef and cotton. Historically, it
      recorded high levels of deforestation until 2004, when rates plummeted 93%
      between that year (11,814 km²) and 2010 (828 km²).  Mato Grosso has
      achieved drastic reductions in deforestation in its territory, which has
      dropped from 11,814 km2 in 2004 to 1,048 km2 in 2014, a decrease of more
      than 90% in deforestation in the Amazon biome.</p><p>In 2009, the state
      prepared the Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation and
      Burning in Mato Grosso (PPCDQ-MT). The Plan establishes an articulated
      system of action at the state level, with the objective of achieving the
      goal of voluntary reduction of forest emissions from the state, which
      coincides with the goal stipulated by the federal government. In addition
      to reducing deforestation and forest fires, the Plan seeks to intensify
      the state's sustainable development efforts. </p><p>For the 2006-2010
      period, set by the State Government as the first period in its Action Plan
      for Prevention and Control of Deforestation and Burning of the State of
      Mato Grosso - PPCDQ / MT, the goal was to reduce 64% of deforestation in
      the forest, and the State achieved a reduction of 68.28%. For the second
      commitment period, from 2011 to 2015, the target reduction of
      deforestation was of 75%, and a reduction of 80% was achieved. For the
      third period, 2016-2020, the target is to reduce deforestation in
      80%.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

            </em></p><p>The State of Mato Grosso, through its governor, launched
            the "Strategy: Produce, Conserve and Include" (PCI) at the Climate
            Convention (COP 21) held in Paris in December 2015, with the
            objective of raising funds for the State of Mato Grosso to expand
            and increase the efficiency of agricultural and forestry production,
            conserve native vegetation, restore deforested and degraded areas,
            support the socioeconomic inclusion of family agriculture, and
            generate emission reductions and carbon sequestration of 6 MTCO2eq
            by controllingdeforestation and developing a low carbon economy. It
            is the largest global effort to mitigate climate change ever devised
            by a subnational state.<br>This strategy arose from a collective and
            participatory process involving different state secretaries,
            representatives of non-governmental organizations, private
            companies, and representatives of different productive sectors.The
            initiative is based on the premise that the State could obtain
            better results by establishing a partnership between the public
            sector, the private sector, and other stakeholder seeking to meet a
            common social interest.<br>For the implementation of the strategy,
            the organizational structure of the PCI Committee - CEEPCI -- was
            created, through Decree No. 468, of March 31, 2016. The Committee is
            responsible for approving the actions developed by the coordinating

            <p><em>Recognition of sustainable soy production programs in Mato
            Grosso as a guarantee of supply for European
            importers.</em></p><p>On January 19, 2017, a Memorandum of
            Understanding (MoU) was signed by AproSoja, ABIOVE, FEFAC, FEDIOL
            and IDH at the Brazilian Embassy in Lisbon. The objective of the
            agreement is to strengthen cooperation in the area of responsible
            soy production in Brazil. Brazil has developed comprehensive and
            detailed legislation to preserve its rich biodiversity, notably the
            Brazilian Forest Code. This strong regulation leads to a substantial
            protection and regeneration of natural habitats on the private
            properties of Brazilian rural producers, who face a challenge of
            competitiveness since this type of legislation differs strongly from
            what is done in the rest of the world.<br>MoU signatories recognize
            that implementation of environmental legislation requires
            coordinated and meaningful supportive actions by farmers and supply
            chain partners to preserve the balance between environmental and
            social protection objectives and the economic viability of Brazilian
            agriculture. The Aprosoja / ABIOVE Soja Plus program and the FEFAC
            Soy Sourcing guidelines play an important role in achieving the
            common goal of improving the sustainability of soybean production in
            Brazil, in parallel with landscape and restoration initiatives,
            including the Regularization Program (PRA), in collaboration with
            IDH.</p>

            Mato Grosso Institute of Meats (Imac), is a partner in the Carrefour
            group initiative which establishes traceability of sustainably
            produced beef that will be resold in the supermarkets of the
            network. The program was launched in August 2016.<br>Based on a
            national policy for the purchase of fresh beef, the company has
            adopted a system to monitor the production processes and
            socio-environmental practices of all its suppliers in the country.
            The tool will be implemented in partnership with the 22 suppliers of
            fresh beef that they provide to the company and which must strictly
            comply with the criteria and good practices established by this
            policy. The initiative reinforces the Carrefour Group's global
            commitment to zero deforestation and its commitment to maintaining
            partnerships that foster sustainable production practices.</p>
