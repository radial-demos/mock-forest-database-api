      <p>The State of Amazonas is Brazil’s largest state with an area of more
      than 1.5 million km², of which more than half is in protected areas. The
      state retains nearly 97% of its original forest cover and has the largest
      tropical forest carbon stock of any sub-national jurisdiction on the
      planet. Half of the state’s population of 3.3 million resides in the
      capital, Manaus, while the other half is distributed among 61 counties.
      Amazonas is home to 66 indigenous peoples. Furthermore, thousands of
      plants, animals, and insects—most of which are still unknown to
      science—are found in Amazonas’ forests.</p><p>Amazonas is a pioneer in
      establishing state-wide public policies related to climate change and
      designing positive incentives for forest conservation. In 2007, Amazonas
      established its State Policy on Climate Change (PEMC) (law 3.135/2007) and
      a complementary law (53/2007), which establishes the State System for
      Protected Areas (SEUC). These were followed by the development of the
      State’s Deforestation Prevention and Control Plan (PPCDAM), involving a
      broad range of state secretariats in an integrated effort to develop ways
      of reducing deforestation while creating new economic alternatives.
      Combined, these policies have helped to reduce deforestation from
      activities such as land grabbing, illegal logging, soy farming and cattle
      ranching from a 10-year average (1996-2005) of 868 km² to 474 km² in
      2010.</p><p>Another strategy adopted by the Amazonas State Government was
      the creation of a public-private foundation, the Sustainable Amazonas
      Foundation (FAS), to manage the Bolsa Floresta Program (PBF). PBF is a
      pioneer pilot program for payments for ecosystem services that supports 15
      State Protected Areas.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

      <p>Expansion of ranching, agriculture and illegal land occupation has
      increased pressure on forests, particularly in southern Amazonas. In the
      southreastern counties of Apuí, Manicoré, and Novo Aripuanã, small family
      agriculture is increasingly being replaced by cattle ranching in large
      INCRA settlement projects. At the border with Acre and Rondônia, in the
      counties of Canutama, Lábrea and Boca do Acre, immigration from the
      neighboring states via the BR-364 and BR-317 highways is accompanied by
      the expansion of cattle ranching and logging. Forests in other counties,
      such as Manicoré, Humaitá, Canutama, and Lábrea, are under pressure from
      expanding industrial crop production, driven by increased access to
      financial resources and improved technology.</p>

            one of eight programs instituted by the State Policy on Climate
            Change which benefits more than 40,000 people in 576 communities in
            16 state conservation units. The Juma partnership has brought
            impressive results: there are currently more than 2,000 people
            directly benefited in 39 communities, with investments of more than
            R $8 million, deforestation fell by 15 more times in comparison to

            prefecture and local private entrepreneurs. The project received

            production and native forest. Since 2012, coffee productivity in
            Apuí has increased from nine to twenty-two coffee sacks per hectare.
            In 2015 Agroforstry Apuí Coffee was launched as the first
            environmentally sustainable coffee produced in the Brazilian Amazon.
            In its first year alone, 4.5 tons of coffee, or 18,000 packages,
            were sold at more than 20 retailers and 50 events and fairs. Today,
