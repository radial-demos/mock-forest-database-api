      -</strong>The Regional Climate Change Strategy of Ucayali is a tool to

      actions, programs and projects in a coordinated and articulated way with
      national policies that lead to adequate adaptation and mitigation of
      inevitable climate change. The Region of Ucayali, as an Amazonian region,
      is highly vulnerable to effects of climate change because it has a great
      biodiversity of flora and interrelated fauna in fragile ecosystems and
      settled indigenous populations on the banks of rivers and streams, which
      can be directly affected. This strategy highlights the need for action to
      adapt to changes in climate, giving priority to vulnerable areas and
      mitigating the effects of climate change, such as floods and damage to
      agricultural products. In addition, it gives priority to research, such as

            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of

            development and create synergies between regional governments, the
            private business sector, producer organizations, NGOs and
            organizations representing indigenous peoples. The coalition has
            established an agenda to promote development amazon focused on: i)
            ensuring land rights and forest native communities and agricultural
            and forestry producers; ii) optimizing the sustainable use of forest
            landscapes in the Amazon; iii) building the set of enabling
            conditions and generate the necessary changes for rural development
            low emission. Goals of the coalition include reducing deforestation
            associated with agriculture, creating roadmaps for public - private
            coordination by Amazon region, designing an architecture of
            financing, increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and
            increasing the value of forests and promote forest plantations. It
            is expected that these measures will open a pathway to build
            sustainable jurisdictions, especially in the value chains of the
            Amazon through a Production - Protection approach. A group of
            companies from the Pro Ucayali network, comprising the largest
            companies in the region, have joined the coalition.</p>
