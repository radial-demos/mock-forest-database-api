      <p>Chiapas is the eighth largest state in Mexico, with an area of 73,282
      km², which represents 3.8% of Mexico's total area. It has a rich
      biodiversity with cloud forests, temperate, natural and induced
      grasslands, humid tropical and sub-humid areas and tropical rainforest
      (INEGI, 2010). These different types of forests cover 42% of the total
      area of the state (PACCCH, 2011). As a result, 30% of Mexico's surface
      water is found in Chiapas. It also has 47 Natural Protected Areas covering
      19.8% of the total surface area of the state (SEMAHN, 2010). </p><p>In
      2009, the state government launched the Climate Change Action Program for
      the State of Chiapas (PACCCH), with the participation of many local and
      national actors. PACCCH generated an analysis of deforestation and forest
      degradation in the state and created projections for the future, as well
      as a state inventory of greenhouse gases. The institutional and legal
      framework for mitigation and adaptation to climate change was created
      through the publication of the Law on Adaptation to Climate Change and
      Mitigation that established the State Commission on Climate Change, a
      group of 15 state government agencies with responsibility for
      implementation. In a sense, the development and implementation of
      adaptation and mitigation policies is a result of the participation of
      many organized civil society actors. </p><p>The REDD + Technical Advisory
      Council (CTC REDD + CH), officially established in 2011, is currently
      working with the Ministry of the Environment on regulations for climate
      change and the development of the state REDD+ strategy, with input from
      civil society organizations, Federal agencies, and academic institutions
      in Chiapas. The objective is to issue a state REDD+ strategy in 2013, and
      a regional REDD+ strategy by 2015. The state is working to align its
      efforts with the National Vision for REDD+ and the National REDD+
      Strategy, in that regard, attend meetings with the Technical Council REDD+
      National Consultative and align efforts on issues of: safeguards, goals
      and processes, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification, and institutional
      and legal frameworks.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

      <p><strong>Rights and Tenure</strong></p><p><strong>Legal support and
      protection of forest tenure.</strong> <br />In Mexico, communal ownership
      of land is secured by the Constitution, Article 27. The state of Chiapas
      recognizes and respects property rights in accordance to the law. However,
      there are conflicts over land tenure and property limits among neighboring
      ejidos and comunidades throughout the state. The SRA (Ministry of the
      Agrarian Reform) is in charge of dealing with these controversies. The
      government of Chiapas has, in some cases, participated to mediate and
      settle land tenure controversies. At the &quot;Zona Lacandona,&quot; most
      agrarian conflicts have already been solved. Plus, they have their own
      legal advisors about land tenure. </p><p><strong>Conflict resolution
      measures.</strong> <br />At the local level, communities have their own
      institutions for conflict resolution. In agrarian ejidos and communities,
      decisions that affect them as a whole are voted on in assemblies.
      Conflicts over land and resources are solved by the ejido's, the
      community's Consejo de Vigilancia, the Comisariado de Bienes Comunales, at
      the general assembly, or eventually at the Agrarian Tribunal. The Ministry
      for Agrarian Reform has the responsibility to resolve property conflicts
      between the government and private land-owners.</p><p><strong>Needs

      municipalities, with public, social, academic and private sector
      participation.</li><li> In 2012, we carried out training of trainers
      workshops about climate change and the role of forests in 11 strategic
      sites in Chiapas, covering 45 municipalities, with a total of 297
      participants,including community leaders, social organizations, rural
      landowners, academicresearchers, municipal and state public
      officials.</li><li>Manuals for communities and trainers, copies of the

      the forests, Payment for Ecosystemservices, REDD+ mechanism and the status
      of international, national, state andmunicipal climate change
      policy.</li><li>The public policy proposals and comments were also

      last year, we carried out workshops to collectively develop the REDD+
      Vision through the identification of direct and indirect deforestation
      drivers in different regions in Chiapas,and the strategies needed to
      tackle the causes, in the 5 areas specified in the national REDD+ Vision:
      Public policy and institutional framework, capacity building, legal
      framework, public participation, identification of safeguards and MRV.
      </li><li> We invited and financially supported the participation of
      indigenous representativesfrom the Lacandona forest, coffee cooperatives
      and regional forestry association representatives. </li><li>Other
      indigenous and productive sectors were identified for future meetings, and
      we learnt that many indigenous representatives, especially from the
      Lacandona forest expressed an interest in participating in future
      meetings; finally it is important to invest in developingand implementing
      communication and consultation strategies.  </li><li>We hope to finalize
      the integration of the final REDD+ Vision document in the next few months,
      and start on the elaboration of the state REDD+ strategy this year, to

            Program initiated a project to improve global forest management and
            protection on 300 million hectares of tropical forest "Forest 2020"
            to assist countries with high biological diversity improve the
            management and conservation of their forest ecosystems, through the
            monitoring of tropical forests. Ecometrica is the international
            consortium that brings together international experts for the
            monitoring of forests in the world, including: University of
            Edinburgh, University of Leicester and Edinburgh Carbomap. For
            Mexico, window areas were selected in two states, Jalisco
            (345,531.82 ha.) and Chiapas (500,015.61 ha.), by signing
            collaboration agreements with local partners such as FIPRODEFO in
            Jalisco, PRONATURA-SUR, AMBIO and ECOSUR in Chiapas.</p>

            Government of the State of Chiapas and the International Union for
            the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are carrying out the design of a

            encourages productivity and supports the objectives set out in the
            Chiapas State Development Plan 2013-2018 and facilitates the
            fulfillment of the commitments made in different international
            agreements at the country level (the 15 goals of Aichi of the CBD,
            the UNFCCC REDD + goal , the zero net land degradation goal of Rio +
            20) and at the state level (Rio Branco Declaration on rural
            low-emission development under the GCF Task Force).<br>The design of
            the strategy is the first step for the State Government to join the
            global Bonn Challenge initiative (http://www.bonnchallenge.org/),
            which aims at restoring 150 million hectares of land deforested and
            degraded by 2020 and 350 million by 2030.</p>

            through the head of the Executive Branch, signed an agreement with
            the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) a Coordination Agreement
            for the development and implementation of the Emissions Reduction
            Initiative through the investment programs with scope in the

            activities that will be developed under the Emissions Reduction
            Initiative have been defined according to local realities to ensure
            that the causes of deforestation and forest degradation in each
            region of the State are addressed.<br>To implement the economic
            activities in a sustainable and long-term manner, it is necessary to
            have a state financing scheme that allows to attract financial
            resources from different national and international sources, public
            and private, that can function as an impact investment for the
            development of sustainable rural activities and capacity building in
            the producers, associations of producers, ejidos and communities of
            the state.</p>

            social risk management through which Chiapas, as one of the 5
            Mexican states within the Emission Reduction Initiative (IRE), will
            promote the guidelines, mechanisms and procedures established in the
            World Bank Safeguards Framework to reduce and manage risks, and
            enhance the benefits associated with REDD + activities that will be
            developed within its territory associated with the intervention area
            established in the Investment Program registered in the IRE. The PES
            will have a validity of 5 years, period in which the IRE will be
            executed. Chiapas drafted its Plan, which Mexico proposed to the
            World Bank in June 2017. After the validation, the final version of
            the PES will be integrated in each of the 5 Mexican states.</p>
