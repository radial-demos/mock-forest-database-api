      <p>Jalisco has a population of 7,979,530 inhabitants. The state's
      population represents 6.5% of the country's total. It is one of the 6 most
      biodiverse states of the country, counting on an enormous wealth in
      natural capital. The trends of economic growth, urbanization and
      demography of the last years have put pressure on the natural resources
      stock.</p><p>With the purpose of establishing a model for territorial
      planning at the regional level, a model of local governance has been
      proposed in Jalisco which aims to contribute to sustainable rural
      development through various procedures that should be observed at the
      state level in order to reduce emissions through deforestation and
      degradation, through the State REDD + Strategy. This model of governance
      is the Intermunicipal Boards, which are based on the association of
      municipalities that seek to generate a decentralization of environmental
      policy and function as a technical agent, which takes the form of a
      decentralized public body, which has an impact on the territory of the
      municipalities that comprise it. There are 2,357,236 ha of forests and
      forests, which represent 57% of the state's forest area.</p><p>Additional

            <p>In 2016, the Ministry of Rural Development modified its operating
            rules to support the implementation of silvopastoral systems
            (sustainable livestock), aimed at livestock producers who had a
            current Agreement on Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) in the
            forest adjacent to their livestock activity. This year, the concept
            of support is extended to agroforestry systems and other forest
            conservation and / or management requirements are included, in
            addition to the PES; such as the Sustainable Forest Management Plan,
            Environmental Management Unit and Voluntary Conservation Area. As
            part of this effort, the Secretariat signed an agreement with each
            of the Intermunicipal Councils for the Environment of coastal
            basins, which are part of the Emission Reduction Initiative proposed
            by Mexico before the FCPF Carbon Fund, whose purpose is to provide
            technical assistance to the beneficiaries of the program. The
            alliance aims to promote sustainable production, increase resilience
            of rural producers and capture carbon, as well as conserve carbon

            Environment and Territorial Development and the Intermunicipal
            Councils for the Environment of coastal basins of Jalisco signed
            agreements in 2016 and 2017 with the objective of investing in 34
            productive projects for the management and sustainable use of
            resources by women and young people living in areas of high and very
            high marginalization. The alliance with the social sector also seeks
            for these supported projects to provide certain inputs for the
            silvopastoral-agroforestry systems promoted by the agricultural
            sector. In this sense, nurseries were supported by women who produce
            plants of interest to the community, as well as forage and timber
            species that can be sold to farmers; support was also given to young
            people to produce compost. This does not exclude other productive
            activities of women and young people who consider the management and
            sustainable use of local natural resources. As part of this
            initiative, the Ministry of Environment and Territorial Development
            will provide technical assistance to the projects of women and young
            people benefiting from these resources at each of the Intermunicipal
            Councils for the Environment of coastal basins; which is the area of
