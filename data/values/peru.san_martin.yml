      <p>San Martín is located in the eastern part of Peru. It has an area of 51
      253 km ², of which about 62.3% are covered with forest.</p><p>Over the
      past few years, San Martin has been working to develop an institutional
      framework for forest conservation and the generation of opportunities with
      a low green development focus on emissions. Thus, in 2010 it created the
      Regional Environmental Authority (ARA), the first in the Peruvian Amazon,
      which has made it possible to centralize oversight of natural resources,
      environment and territory policies, and forest management under a single
      entity.</p><p>One of the most important policies is the development of the
      Regional Conservation System which has three conservation corridors
      (North, Central and South corridors).  The conservation system integrates
      the territories under different conservation modalities in the
      territory.</p><p>In the future, the challenge is to formulate and
      implement a low-emission development strategy. The strategy must use a
      landscape approach to environmental/forest management that account for
      both human and ecosystem needs,  allowing the region to address
      socio-economic need while stopping the advance of
      deforestation.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a

            are led by the regional governments and are open to the
            participation of any public or private institution that wishes to
            contribute. 3FI considers with special attention the participation
            of indigenous peoples and women in the activities to be carried out.
            The initiative is based on empowering the progress of each region to
            make the necessary incentives proposals by building tailored
            instruments for each jurisdiction. Output from the project include:
            (a) developing regional plans or roadmaps to promote a transition to
            low-emission rural development; (b) promoting a transparent dialogue
            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of
            indigenous peoples and women; and (c) developing a business plan to
            attract private investment and promote low-emission rural
            development in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>

            development and create synergies between regional governments, the

            established an agenda to promote development amazon focused on: i)
            ensuring land rights and forest native communities and agricultural
            and forestry producers; ii) optimizing the sustainable use of forest
            landscapes in the Amazon; iii) building the set of enabling
            conditions and generate the necessary changes for rural development
            low emission. Goals of the coalition include reducing deforestation
            associated with agriculture, creating roadmaps for public - private
            coordination by Amazon region, designing an architecture of
            financing, increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and
            increasing the value of forests and promote forest plantations. It
            is expected that these measures will open a pathway to build
            sustainable jurisdictions, especially in the value chains of the
            Amazon through a Production - Protection approach. A group of
            companies from the Pro Ucayali network, comprising the largest
            companies in the region, have joined the coalition.</p>
