      <p>Huánuco is located in the central part of the country, it contains the
      three mountain ranges of the northern Andes of Peru and extends to the
      Ucayali River.  The region is home to vast swaths of forests in the Amazon
      Basin. Its boundaries are:<br />- to the North: with the departments of La
      Libertad, San Martín, Loreto and Ucayali.<br />- to the South: with the
      Pasco department.<br />- to the East: with the Ucayali department.<br />to
      the West: with the Ancash and Lima departments</p><p>The region is divided
      into 11 provinces and 77 districts.  </p><p>The departmental territorial
      surface of 36,848.85 Km², represents 2.87% of the national territory, in
      which seven of the eight Natural Regions can be found (except for the
      Chala region). If we refer to the three natural regions: covered in 64.06%
      of mountains, 23.84% of hills, 2.77% of piedmont and 8.33% of plains. The
      territory of the department has been widely dissected (sunken, deepened)
      by orogenic processes closely related to the Andean uprising, so Huánuco
      contains in its interior the three mountain ranges of the northern Andes
      of Peru; the western, the central and the oriental. These chains have
      originated as much by the Andean uprising as by the carving that in
      millions of years have made the Marañón, Huallaga and Pachitea rivers,
      rivers that run almost parallel from south to north and that help to shape
      the Huanuco territory, generating three large spatial assemblies: the
      Marañón basin, the Huallaga basin and the Pachitea basin.</p><p>Additional

            Peru, the 3FI initiative is led by the Earth Innovation Institute
            and the Amazon Regional Council (CIAM, in Spanish) and is developing
            incentives for low-emission rural development under a production and

            are led by the regional governments and are open to the
            participation of any public or private institution that wishes to
            contribute. 3FI considers with special attention the participation
            of indigenous peoples and women in the activities to be carried out.
            The initiative is based on empowering the progress of each region to
            make the necessary incentives proposals by building tailored
            instruments for each jurisdiction. Output from the project include:
            (a) developing regional plans or roadmaps to promote a transition to
            low-emission rural development; (b) promoting a transparent dialogue
            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of
            indigenous peoples and women; and (c) developing a business plan to
            attract private investment and promote low-emission rural
            development in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>

            and forestry producers; ii) optimizing the sustainable use of forest

            conditions and generate the necessary changes for rural development
            low emission. Goals of the coalition include reducing deforestation
            associated with agriculture, creating roadmaps for public - private
            coordination by Amazon region, designing an architecture of
            financing, increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and
            increasing the value of forests and promote forest plantations. It
            is expected that these measures will open a pathway to build

            Amazon through a Production - Protection approach. A group of
