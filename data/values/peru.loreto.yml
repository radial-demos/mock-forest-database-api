      <p>Loreto is the largest regions - and the region with the greatest forest
      cover -  in Peru. It currently has more than 13 million hectares of forest
      under forms of conservation (apart from national administration),
      concessions for non-timber purposes and conservation of watershed
      headwaters.</p><p>One of its most important forest policies is the
      Regional Program for the Conservation, Management and Sustainable Use of
      Loreto Biological Diversity (PROCREL), which conserves forests, together
      with local governments and communities and NGOs.  PROCREL works to
      strengthen forest management and generate economic income for communities
      through the development of sustainable productive alternatives in the
      Regional Conservation Areas (ACRs). Today Loreto has 5 ACRs connected
      between them, making a total of more than 2 million hectares where more
      than 98 native communities live.</p><p>In the future, the challenge is to
      formulate and implement a holistic low-emission development strategy which
      balances socioeconomic needs and forest conservation using a landscape
      approach.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the<a

            Peru, the 3FI initiative is led by the Earth Innovation Institute
            and the Amazon Regional Council (CIAM, in Spanish) and is developing
            incentives for low-emission rural development under a production and
            protection approach. The activities of 3FI in the Peruvian Amazon
            are led by the regional governments and are open to the
            participation of any public or private institution that wishes to
            contribute. 3FI considers with special attention the participation
            of indigenous peoples and women in the activities to be carried out.
            The initiative is based on empowering the progress of each region to
            make the necessary incentives proposals by building tailored
            instruments for each jurisdiction. Output from the project include:
            (a) developing regional plans or roadmaps to promote a transition to
            low-emission rural development; (b) promoting a transparent dialogue
            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of
            indigenous peoples and women; and (c) developing a business plan to
            attract private investment and promote low-emission rural
            development in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>
