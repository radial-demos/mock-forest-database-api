      <p>Acre is one of Brazil´s Federal Units with an area of 164.123.040 km2
      and is divided into 22 municipalities. The population estimate for the
      year 2014 was 790,101 with a population density of 4.47 inhabitants/km²,
      and the projection for the year 2030 is 972,464 inhabitants. Despite its
      small area, Acre has an immense biological wealth resulting from its
      geological and climatic conditions. With altitudes ranging from 250 to 580
      meters, the landscape contains hills and plateaus inherited from its
      paleogeographical evolution, and wetlands and flood areas with typical
      vegetation types. The climate is characterized by two distinct periods: a
      “summer” with temperatures between 24,5 and 32o C, 1.600 to 2.750 mm of
      rainfall per year and high humidity, and a dry “winter” that may extend
      for up to 3 months. Acre has over 87% of its original forest intact, of
      which 47% are protected areas, 14% indigenous lands and 33% conservation
      units, demonstrating the conservation strategy adopted in its development
      policy and maintaining a rich biodiversity under canopy of different
      forest formations.</p><p>The state of Acre is one of the most advanced
      REDD jurisdictions in the world. In 2010, Acre enacted its landmark Law
      2.308/2010, creating a State System of Incentives for Environmental
      Services (SISA), with REDD as the centerpiece. It provides an innovative,
      jurisdiction-wide approach to low-carbon rural development. The SISA
      establishes a set of principles, policies, institutions, and instruments
      for building an effective program for achieving environmental
      sustainability through ecosystem services incentives. It is designed to
      promote public-private initiatives to achieve the state’s goals with
      respect to ecosystem services. Notably, Acre established its SISA law
      through in-depth consultation with local stakeholders and civil society,
      in compliance with national level REDD+ safeguards principles and
      criteria.</p><p>Acre´s state government has chosen a different development
      model, exploring the natural resources wisely, aware of the need to
      preserve this valuable natural capital. Over the last fifteen years, the
      state government has been innovating with a green economy model, reducing
      deforestation, increasing its GDP and revolutionizing with
      socio-productive inclusion. Starting from Acre´s Ecological-Economic
      Zoning (ZEE), the Valuation of Forest and Environmental Assets Policy was
      passed into state law (Law 2.2204/2008), with the main objective of
      ensuring the sustainable use and proper management of the territory with
      social and economic inclusion. This policy has contributed to the
      mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and the consequent reduction
      of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Acre State Government has the
      implementation of its Prevention and Control of Deforestation, Burning and
      Forest Fires Plan (PPCDQ) as one of its main policy instruments aimed at
      reducing the impacts of climate change. This plan establishes guidelines,
      goals and actions until 2030, for territorial and land planning,
      productive chains and sustainable practices, and monitoring, control and
      surveillance. In the period 2004-2014, the state showed a 57% reduction in
      deforestation compared to the average for the decade 1995-2004, with
      average annual increment of 300 km² (PRODES, 2014)</p><p>Additional

      i) monitoring, control and surveillance, ii) territorial and land planning
      and iii) agroforestry production chains and sustainable practices.
      </p><p><em>State System for Environmental Services (SISA) -</em> The state
      of Acre pioneered SISA which created the first jurisdictional, state level
      REDD+ program.   SISA was created by<a
      href="http://gcftaskforce-database.org/assets/downloads/GCFF/database/Acre%20-%20SISA.pdf">
      State Law 2.308/2010</a>and covers carbon sequestration, maintenance of
      water and hydrological services, conservation of soils, conservation of
      biodiversity, and valuation of traditional knowledge.  The SISA law
      created a number of institutions to administer the system and procure
      funding for it. Among these are the Institute of Climate Change and
      Regulation of Environmental Services (IMC), which regulates SISA and
      registers and monitors private REDD+ projects; the Commission for
      Validation and Accompaniment (CEVA), which monitors SISA and approves
      regulations, norms and implementation approaches.</p><p>Within SISA Acre
      has developed Program of Incentives for Environmental Services-Carbon
      (ISA-Carbono). The program is designed to include the entire state
      territory, incorporating regional and thematic sub-programs as well as
      special REDD projects. Regional sub-programs are related to REDD actions.
      One sub-program identifies priority areas in those areas most at risk for
      deforestation, to date encompassing 5.4 million ha over 8 areas. Thematic
      sub-programs to address or develop REDD actions in indigenous territories
      and protected areas will be designed, depending on the priorities
      identified by the government. Special REDD projects are associated with
      REDD actions carried out in areas such as private properties or individual
      protected areas or similar land categories.</p><p>The ISA-Carbono Program
      is comprised of 2 sets of main interventions, including (1) direct
      assistance and regulatory actions such as technical extension, community
      organization, fire control, and improvement of monitoring and control
      mechanisms, and (2) incentives for environmental services directed to
      improving the productivity of deforested areas as well as to promote
      sustainable use of forests and protection of forests for stakeholders such
      as indigenous peoples, extractivist families and small households in
      settlement projects. Program governance is carried out by 3 entities: (1)
      a multi-stakeholder commission to supervise the program, (2) a government
      institute for regulation, monitoring and carbon registry, and (3) an
      agency (CDSA) for environmental services development—a private-public
      business to fundraise for and implement the
      ISA-Carbono.</p><p><strong>Laws and Regulations</strong></p><p><a

      <p><strong>Land/forest tenure administration and relation with
      REDD</strong></p><p>1. Legal support and protection of forest
      tenure</p><p>In federal areas such as Extractive Reserves (Resex), the
      Interministerial Decree No. 13(published on September 19, 2002) aimed to
      recognize the traditional populations in Resex, as recipients of the
      National Plan for Agrarian Reform - PNRA, following the operational
      procedures adopted by INCRA and IBAMA. Based on Norm #40 of March 30,
      2004, residents of Resex were declared as beneficiaries of agrarian
      reform, with full rights to credits designated to any household family in
      a Settlement Project.</p><p>The Land Institute of Acre - ITERACRE, created
      by Law #1373 of 04 March 2001, is the agency responsible for agrarian
      policy in the State, land tenure regulation and zoning, development of the
      State’s Land Registry, and mediation of conflicts over land ownership in
      areas under the State's jurisdiction.</p><p>Forest management in Acre is
      regulated by Law #1426 (December 27, 2001) known as the Forest Law.
      Currently, the Federal Law #11284 of March 2, 2006 (Forest Management Act)
      and the State Forest Law authorize Forest Concessions, with the obligation
      to draw up an Annual Forest Concession Plan - PAOF. The main objective of
      the Acre PAOF in 2009 was to make two state forests available for
      concessions. The communities living in state forests had their land rights
      recognized and a title for usufruct was granted to these
      communities.</p><p>Regarding Indigenous People’s rights to land, the
      Brazilian Constitution defines the rights of indigenous peoples to their
      lands as a right acquired prior to the existence of the Brazilian State
      and also ensures respect for their social organization, customs,
      languages, beliefs and traditions.</p><p>2. Clear responsibilities,
      capacity and authority for forest tenure administration</p><p>Considering
      that most of Acre’s territory is located in range of the Peruvian and
      Bolivian borders, and is thus under federal authority, only 14.6% of the
      land is under Acre State’s jurisdiction (ITERACRE). In the nearly 85% of
      the territory jurisdiction, INCRA (National Agrarian Reform Institute) is
      responsible for land tenure regulation.</p><p>FUNAI is a federal
      institution under the Ministry of Justice, responsible for public policies
      involving indigenous peoples, with the prerogative to promote the
      protection and demarcation of indigenous territories as well the
      protection of the inheritance of these peoples.</p><p>3. Actions planned
      or developed by governments to solve issues related to land tenure
      uncertainties within REDD priority areas</p><p>Following the agreement
      between the State Government and INCRA in 2008, the relationship of state
      environmental and territorial agencies has been evolving with the regional
      INCRA office in Acre into a more effective collaboration for regulation of
      settlement projects. The cooperation has strengthened the development of
      management plans for these areas and enabled easier access to credit for
      members of the settlement communities.</p><p>The federal Ministry for
      Agrarian Development and the government of Acre announced an agreement of
      $13.5 million from the Legal Land Program for activities related to
      regulation of land tenure on rural properties in the state of Acre and
      public areas located along the BR-364 highway between Sena Madureira and
      Cruzeiro do Sul.</p><p>The Environmental Licensing of Rural Properties
      System (MLAPR) within the Environment Institute of Acre (IMAC) is a rural
      environmental registry that can be used as a tool for land tenure
      regulation. The Sustainable Rural Property Certification Project, which
      provides incentives (bonuses and inputs) to adopt more sustainable
      production practices (including eliminating the use of fire and
      deforestation), is also intended to assist farmers in achieving compliance
      with environmental regulations. Through this project, small household
      farmers make a multi-year land use plans for their properties on a
      voluntary basis, receiving technical assistance and an annual incentive
      called a bonus.</p><p>4. Relationship between forest tenure resolution and
      REDD objectives/actions</p><p>5. Recognition of communities and indigenous
      peoples’ rights</p><p>The State of Acre has advanced with respect to land
      tenure regulation within Extractive Reserves as well as granting real
      right of use to residents in state lands.</p><p>By 2009, 28 Indigenous
      Territories (TI) for 14 indigenous peoples with an estimated population of
      12,720 individuals have been recognized in the state of Acre. Another 6
      areas are in the process of being identified. Together, these areas
      comprise a total of 2,320,232 ha (14.1% of the state's
      territory).</p><p>6. Participation of communities and indigenous peoples
      in forest tenure definition</p><p>In order to create protected areas
      (conservation units and indigenous territories), public consultation to
      define the concession of use of public land to the local population is
      carried out since the land title belongs to the State but right of use is
      ceded to inhabitants.</p><p>INCRA is responsible for Agrarian Land Reform
      Settlement Projects, which involve consultation processes and
      establishment of a landless families’ registry. INCRA defines a process
      where the concession of use is given to a household for a transitional
      period of time before the legal land title is authorized, depending on the
      performance of the settled family.</p><p>7. Definition of legal aspects
      related to property and rights to forest carbon in REDD project
      areas.</p><p>- In progress.</p><p>8. Conflict resolution measures in
      place.</p><p>The principle instruments to address conflict related to land
      tenure are the State Zoning (EEZ) plan and its land use guidelines as well
      as the land uses defined by the State Policy Councils (Environment,
      Science and Technology Council, State Council for Forests, and Sustainable
      Forest and Rural Development Council).</p><p><strong>Transparency and
      participation mechanisms</strong></p><p>1. Actions taken to guarantee
      free, prior and informed consent</p><p>The draft Environmental Services
      Incentives System (SISA) law creates an institutional arrangement that
      includes a Hearing Body to receive claims and mediate conflicts. Another

      mechanisms</strong></p><p>1. Describe the broad picture of how REDD
      program addresses social and economic well-being of forest dependent
      communities</p><p>The IES-Carbon Program is founded on the concept of
      incentives for environmental services (IES), which are defined as the
      costs of actions and interventions that result in the maintenance and/or
      increase in the provision of environmental services. The program is
      founded on the belief that this approach is essentially dealing with
      poverty reduction. Incentives are designed to increase the income and
      productivity of agricultural and forestry production systems, which, in
      conjunction with increased command-and-control measures, will lead to
      reduced pressure on forests, thereby assuring the continued provision of
      environmental services.</p><p>The IES differs from the payments for
      environmental services (PES) concept because the service provider is not
      being remunerated for the environmental service. The service provider is
      receiving resources that allow him/her to redirect his/her land use toward
      a more sustainable model.</p><p>2. Description of the PES or benefit
      sharing mechanisms currently in place or planned (concrete
      elements)</p><p>The Program has established guidelines for the development
      of REDD actions within the state that differ for distinct social and/or
      cultural groups. The IES are proposed to offset either entirely or
      partially the costs of actions including:</p><p>- Increasing productivity
      of degraded areas as a way of reducing pressure on forestlands and
      generating income;</p><p>- Sustainable use of forests as a form of
      conserving forestlands and generating income;</p><p>- Forest protection as
      a strategy to diminish the risks associated with forest
      degradation;</p><p>- Restoration of degraded areas through reforestation
      and establishment of agroforestry systems, restoring environmental
      services and producing economically valuable forest assets.</p><p>The
      value of the incentives will be determined in the context of each
      sub-program or project through a process of consultation and participatory
      design with the stakeholders.</p><p>3. Describe evidence of participation
      of stakeholders in the development of the mechanisms</p><p>The
      multi-stakeholder consultation process included discussions on the
      possible activities that could be supported within each incentive as well
      as the range of values these incentives should span. It is hoped that the
      Institute responsible for developing the ToR for the development of the
      subprograms and projects consider these references.</p>

      <p>The majority of deforestation in Acre occurs along primary and
      secondary roads as well as rivers. The main driver of deforestation in
      Acre is cattle ranching (occupying 70% of the total area deforested in
      1989 and increasing to 81% in 2004). Factors such as land speculation,
      lack of zoning and formal designation of public lands, profitability of
      cattle ranching, and subsidized loans for ranching have created incentives
      for deforestation throughout the Amazon, including Acre. Historically, the
      main agents of deforestation agents were owners of mid-size and large
      farms and ranches, but in recent years smallholder farmers have
      contributed significantly to deforestation in Acre. The pavement of the
      BR-317 (completed in 2007) and BR-364 (scheduled completion in 2011)
      highways now connect the southwestern Amazon (including Acre) to Peruvian
      Pacific coast harbors and is likely to lead to increased deforestation.
      The risk of deforestation is likely to be most intense along the BR-364
      from Sena Madureira to Cruzeiro do Sul.</p>
