      <p>The territory of the State of Campeche has an area of 56,859 km2 of
      which 76.2% is still a mosaic of forests in relatively good condition. The
      state has the largest mangrove area (197,000 ha), in Mexico, which is
      equivalent to 30% of the national total. These forests and mangroves have
      the highest carbon storage capacities, above 100 MgCl / ha (Government of
      the State of Campeche, 2012b). Campeche has the largest area under
      protection (2,278,765.59 ha) through Protected Natural Areas (ANP's) in
      the Yucatan Peninsula, representing 40% of the state's surface. The good
      state of conservation and connectivity of the states of Campeche, Yucatan
      and Quintana Roo, with the forests of Guatemala and Belize in Central
      America, make the jungles of Campeche one of the areas for the survival of
      threatened and endangered species with high spatial requirements such as
      felines (jaguar and puma), or that perform local &quot;migrations&quot;
      (such as birds or butterflies). Recent studies in Mexico infer that the
      forests of Campeche probably maintain the largest populations of species
      such as the jaguar (Panthera onca), the tapir (Tapirus bairdii), the
      white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), the howler monkey (Alouatta spp) ,
      the spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), the elegant eagle (Spizaetus
      ornatus), the king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), the ocellated turkey
      (Meleagris ocellata) and the snout (Crax rubra) (Campeche State
      Government, 2012b).</p><p>Most of Campeche's territory is characterized by
      a subhumid climate and a dense tropical forest.  There is also a lowlands
      region with lakes and a riparian area.  The &quot;milpa&quot; system,
      which predominates in the state, requires a deep understanding of specific
      ecological systems, including the cycles of various plants and the rain
      cycle, as well as the fallow period required by its soils.  Hunting and
      gathering are supplementary subsistence activities.  The local natural
      resources are used as materials to build houses and for energy needs. 
      Together, these activities along with forestry and livestock activities,
      have had a devastating impact on the tropical forest, and attempts are
      being made to reverse the impact through sustainable development programs
      focused on reforestation and wildlife management.  The State of Campeche
      faces a great challenge in the face of the potential effects of climate
      change and of the phenomena of deforestation and forest degradation.
      Preservation policy has brought about the creation of various protected
      areas, among them the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve--notable for the number
      of indigenous migrants who live within the reserve's 723,185 hectares of
      forest and also for plans to develop ecological and archaeological tourism
      opportunities.</p><p>More information can be fond on the <a

            <p>At COP 13 of the Conventions on Biodiversity held in Cancun in
            2016, Quintana Roo, the Governments of the Yucatan Peninsula signed
            a collaborative work plan for 2030 called "Agreement for
            Sustainability of the Yucatan Peninsula" (ASPY 2030). This agreement
            strengthens collaboration among subnational governments to
            facilitate transition and compliance with the Paris Agreement, the
            Bonn Challenge, Rio Branco Declaration and the Aichi Goals among
            others. The implementation of the ASPY 2030 will occur through the
            Regional Climate Change Commission, formed through the first
            regional agreement on climate change signed at COP16 in 2010, and
            supported by NGO initiatives such as the Mayan Forest Observatory
            which generates inputs for forest policy. ASPY 2030 covers 8
            components, each with specific lines of action:</p><ul

            be a regional counterpart in the REDD+ payment scheme of the FCPF
            Carbon Fund, in coordination with CONAFOR. This fund started
            operations in December 2016, in phase 1, developing the executive
            plan to implement the trust, coordinating the operational strategy
            of the Advisory Council, designing the fundraising plan and the
            procedures manual. This Fund is a trust that can capture and
            distribute resources in a regional and state way, so that it can
            receive private and international resources for the development of
            climate policy actions.</p>

            <p>The state plan on safeguards (PES for its acronym in Spanish) is
            the operational instrument for environmental and social risk
            management through which Campeche, as one of the 5 Mexican states
            within the Emission Reduction Initiative (IRE) of the FCPF Carbon
            Fund, will promote the guidelines, mechanisms and procedures
            established in the World Bank Safeguards Framework to reduce and
            manage risks and enhance the benefits associated with REDD +
            activities that will be developed within Campeche’s Investment
            Programs for the IRE. The PES will have a validity of 5 years to
            coincide with the implementation of the IRE. Campeche prepared the
            draft of its Plan, which Mexico proposed to the World Bank in June
            2017. After the validation, the final version of the PES of each of
            the 5 Mexican states will be integrated.</p>
