            <p>At COP 13 of the Conventions on Biodiversity held in Cancun in

            a collaborative work plan for 2030 called "Agreement for
            Sustainability of the Yucatan Peninsula" (ASPY 2030). This agreement
            strengthens collaboration among subnational governments to
            facilitate transition and compliance with the Paris Agreement, the
            Bonn Challenge, Rio Branco Declaration and the Aichi Goals among
            others. The implementation of the ASPY 2030 will occur through the
            Regional Climate Change Commission, formed through the first
            regional agreement on climate change signed at COP16 in 2010, and
            supported by NGO initiatives such as the Mayan Forest Observatory
            which generate inputs for forest policy. ASPY 2030 covers 8
            components, each with specific lines of action:</p><ul
            type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal">sustainable agricultural
            development,</li><li class="MsoNormal">effective forest

            of Influence of the State of Yucatan recognizes the historical,

            proposals to improve living conditions and increase levels of
            well-being for Mayan families. The Milpa Program of the Milpera
            Region and area of influence has the purpose of guaranteeing and
            promoting the responsible and efficient use of the ecosystem
            services that ecosystems provide to society and whose benefits are
