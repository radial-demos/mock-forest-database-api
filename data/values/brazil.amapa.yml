      <p>Among the states of the Brazilian Amazon, Amapá has more than 60% of
      its territory (143.453.70 km²) under some special modality of protection,
      there are 19 Conservation Units (CUs). The state has an important forestry
      economic sector, with extraction of wood and non-timber products
      (including açaí, brazil nuts and lianas). Mineral extraction consists of
      91% of the export of the amapaense market, wood contributes 5% and only
      1.5% are fruits, pulps and derivatives of plants. </p><p>The government
      has developed the Plan of Prevention and Control of Deforestation and
      Burning of the State of Amapá (PPCDAP), which aims to contain
      deforestation by means of 4 main types of actions: territorial planning,
      monitoring and control, promotion of sustainable economic activities and
      governance and institutional strengthening. </p><p>Currently, Amapá does
      not have an official regulatory framework on Climate Change, Environmental
      Services or REDD +. However, discussions are ongoing between government,
      civil society and academic institutions about creating a formal strategy
      for environmental services and REDD +. A Bill is being formulated with the
      objective of regulating strategies aimed at encouraging sustainability
      through Environmental Services Payments Programs. </p><p>Currently, the
      use of natural resources on a sustainable basis is one of the greatest
      challenges for the State Government. In this context, the State Forest of
      Amapá (FLOTA / AP) was created, with approximately 23,694 km ². The FLOTA
      / AP is a Sustainable Use Conservation Unit that promotes the orderly
      occupation of land and the use of natural resources in the face of
      principles of sustainable forest management with technical, social,
      economic and ecological approaches. </p><p>Further studies are needed for
      the elaboration of strategies for mitigation and compensation for GHG
      emissions (Greenhouse Gases) arising from anthropization processes in the
      areas of the State forests. In this context, the State Institute of
      Forests of Amapá (IEF / AP) concluded a work that quantified the carbon
      stocks in a fragment of Dense Forest of Terra Firma of FLOTA / AP. This
      study was carried out in collaboration with the National Institute of
      Amazonian Research (INPA) and the Center for Agroforestry Research
      (Embrapa Amapá). </p><p>Embrapa Amapá develops a research project together
      with other national and state institutions, including IEF / AP. The
      objective is to evaluate the environmental services provided by FLOTA /
      AP, with emphasis on module 4. The project completion forecast is
      mid-2013, the information collected will subsidize the implementation of a
      REDD + pilot project in the state of Amapá. </p><p>Additional information

      <p>No official study on the drivers and causes of deforestation for the
      State of Amapá exists, but information on deforestation trends is
      available both from state and federal monitoring programs. An Amapá State
      Secretariat of Environment (SEMA) report on deforestation over the
      2005-2006 period reveals that 130 km² were deforested in the 2005-2006
      period, with 89% of that deforestation occurring within 10 km of roads, in
      accordance with patterns observed elsewhere in the Amazon. The report also
      concludes that 84% of individual patches cleared in this period are
      relatively small, ranging from 0 to 10 ha. These small patches represented
      31% of total deforestation, whereas patches ranging from 10 to 50 ha
      accounted for 33% of total deforestation (but only 14% of all patches
      cleared). One quarter of total deforestation was caused by clearing of
      only 15 large (100-500 ha) patches.  </p><p>Considering that 81% of the
      deforestation in 2005-2006 occured in the savannahs (Cerrado) and in the
      Terra Firme Highland Forests combined and that 37% of this deforestation
      occurred in the cerrado, it is possible to assume that silviculture
      (eucalyptus) has been growing in the cerrado areas and may be responsible
      for deforestation patches over 100 ha. Sixty-three percent of
      deforestation occurred in Dense Highland Forests. Deforestation
      encompasses settlement projects and other small households in protected
      areas dedicated to subsistence agriculture. Eighteen percent of total
      deforestation took place within 31 settlement projects.</p><p>Meanwhile,
      PRODES detected an increase in annual deforestation from 2007 (7 km²) to
      2008 (100 km²). Although this difference falls within the analysis’ margin
      of error (as described in the monitoring methodology), long-term
      monitoring by PRODES shows increasing annual deforestation rates before
      and after this period. </p>
