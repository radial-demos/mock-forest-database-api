      <p>The Province of West Kalimantan covers an area of 147, 000 km and is
      home to 4.25 million people, including an estimated 3.5 million people
      living in its rural hinterland. The Province has a number of large rivers,
      the largest being the Kapuas which drains from the spectacular inland
      wetland of Lake Santarum within the biodiversity region know as the Heart
      of Borneo. Because of its strategic location within SE Asia the old
      capital of Pontianak grew as a port city and it and the other settlements
      along the Kapuas River contain trading communities from a wide range of
      ethnic backgrounds within a cultural matrix dominated by the indigenous
      Dayak who make up 35% of the population. Poverty is a significant issue
      with the HDI below the national average and average income across the
      Province at only USD 627 per year.</p><p>In 2008, the GDP for the Province
      was USD 2.9 million derived mainly from primary industries. The forest
      sector contributed about half of the GDP with a further USD1.35 million
      from the agricultural sector, reflecting a strong investment in estate
      crops particularly oil palm. Lowland tropical peats cover an area of 1.7
      million ha and Conversion of forest lands on peats to estate crops and the
      proliferation of fire through the dry seasons has been a significant
      historical factor in the high levels of GHG emissions from the
      Province.</p><p>The national forest estate consists of an area of about 90
      000 km2 over half of which is zoned as permanent production forest. Only
      5000 km2 of the production forest designated for conversion remains
      attesting to the rapid expansion of estate crops in the Province. 23 000
      km2 are zoned for protection and a further 14,500 km2 for conservation
      purposes within a network of national parks, nature reserves and wildlife
      reserves.   The estimated carbon stock remaining in these forests is 1,600
      Giga Tons CO2e, over half of which is sequestered in the Production
      Forest. Future carbon dioxide emissions will likely be as a result of
      burning of converted peat soils and forest degradation.</p><p>West
      Kalimantan has been a member of the GCF since its foundation and has
      convened a REDD Working Group under the authority of the Governor. At this
      stage the Province has not enacted any specific legislation to facilitate
      REDD and other climate change programs but is proceeding in line with
      national legislation and policy related to reducing carbon emissions. The
      Province hosts several REDD projects including village level carbon pool
      assessments in the Districts of Ketapang and Kapuas Hulu, Ecosystem
      restoration over 90 000 ha in the Putri River and Lake Siawan Belidak in
      collaboration with FFI. There is also an FFI/Macquarie Bank REDD project
      and a demonstration activity supported by the German Government
      (Kfw-FORCLIM). USAID has also recently begun activities through their IFAD
      program in Ketapang. As elsewhere in the member provinces there is still
      to be developed a close working and learning collaboration between the
      provincial government and these REDD projects.</p><p>More information can

            SAMPAN Kalimantan intends to protect the remaining coastlines
            (particularly mangroves) in western Kalimantan. The idea is to
            promote fair and sustainable coastal governance by supporting the
            protection and use of coastal communities through the use of
            community-based forest management models(eg HD, HKm), legislation
            permits on the protection of mangroves. It provides the community
            with access to and control of their forests. The project works with
            village communities but also affects local government.

            <p>In collaboration with the district forestry office, and West
            Kalimantan Provincial Forestry Office, FORCLIME comprehensively
            supports the PHBM development process in two villages, Setulang in
            Malinau District (5,300 ha) and Manua Sadap (1,600 ha) in Kapuas
            Hulu District together with other partners. As a first step and
            based on information on different PHBM options, communities choose
            the PHBM scheme that seems most appropriate to them, that resemble
            their Village Forest. Facilitation activities in two villages
            included the preparation of village forest development proposals,
            training and assistance to strengthen village forest management
            organizations, and legal drafting drafting training. FORCLIME and
            West Kalimantan Government assists in the creation of participatory
            village boundaries, verification of village forest areas and a
            participatory inventory of potential non-timber forest products.
            Capacity development includes skills on how to assess and list the
            quantity and quality of available forest resources and how to
            prepare sustainable forest management plans.</p>
