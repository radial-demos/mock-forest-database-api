      <p>The Government of Rondônia is increasingly committed to prevention and
      control of deforestation, understanding that the current occupation of the
      State has already reached the limits established in the Socio-Economic and
      Ecologic Zoning, requiring urgent measures to promote actions that reduce
      pressure on protected areas - indigenous lands and conservation - and
      begin the process of restoring the altered areas of Legal Reserves and
      Permanent Protection of rural properties. </p><p>Rondônia was occupied as
      a result of the integration policy military government, which intensified
      in the 1970s and 1980s, implementation of the Integrated Colonization
      Projects (ICP) and the Directed Settlement Projects (PAD), under the
      responsibility of the National Agrarian Reform - INCRA. This policy had
      two objectives: first enable the &quot;modernization of agriculture&quot;
      in the center-south of the country, mainly for the expansion of soybeans
      in Paraná, and for beef cattle Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, expelling
      thousands of sharecroppers, squatters, lessees, rural workers and small
      producers who migrated to the agricultural frontier in the Amazon, with
      Rondônia being an option to life. The second objective was to reduce
      tensions in the field and maintain social movement of rural workers under
      state control, hiding misery in the Amazon or in the favelas that widened
      in the outskirts of big cities. In almost forty years of occupation the
      population of Rondônia increased from 130,000 inhabitants in 1970 to
      almost 1,500,000 inhabitants currently.</p><p>Additional information can
