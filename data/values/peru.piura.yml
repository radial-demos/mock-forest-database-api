      latitude South 4º04'50 &quot;and 6º22'10&quot; and longitude West 79º13'15
      &quot;and 81º19'35&quot;; at a distance of 981 km from the city of Lima.
      Its territorial extension is 35,892km2, which represents 2.79% of the
      country's territory.<br />At a political-administrative level, the region
      is divided into 08 provinces: Piura, Sullana, Talara, Paita, Sechura,
      Morropón, Huancabamba and Ayabaca. It also has 65 districts.<br />The
      climate of the department of Piura is varied, the coast is warm with high
      temperatures throughout the year, which fluctuate between 34.2ºC and 15ºC.
      In the mountains, the climate is mild, with rainfall according to the
      season. An important characteristic of the territory is the recurrent
      presence of the &quot;El Niño&quot; FEN Phenomenon, which occurs in
      certain non-periodic periods with positive and negative effects that
      influence Regional behavior.<br />Piura is a region with a unique
      biodiversity, which is an important source of resources on which
      activities such as agriculture, fishing, aquaculture and tourism that
      contribute greatly to the regional economy, it is important to note that
      according to the Ecological and Economic Zoning of the Region (2013),
      22.30% of the continental territory of Piura has aptitude for conservation
      and protection, which reflects the ecological value of several important
      areas in the region.</p><p>Additional information can be found on the <a
