      <p>East Kalimantan Province has jurisdiction over a land area of 200 000
      km2 and a marine environment of 10 000 km2. It is second largest province
      in Indonesia but like Papua, it is sparsely populated with 3.5 million
      people of whom about half live in rural villages. It is rich in natural
      resources with oil and natural gas, coal and gold which linked to its
      forest resources, estate crops and fishing give it the second highest GDP
      behind Jakarta DKI. The capital of East Kalimantan is Samarinda on the
      Mahakam River, while Balikpapan to the south and Tarakan in the far north
      are also large cities. With greater infrastructure and communication and
      transport corridors along the main rivers, service delivery has been much
      easier than in many other part of the country and literacy and levels of
      poverty are much more in line with a province which has benefited from the
      exploitation of its natural resources.</p><p>Nevertheless, the province
      has many challenges with issues in energy generation and the supply of
      water to its urban centers. One consequence of this has been a significant
      focus on alternative sources of sustainable resource use. East Kalimantan
      has been one of the target provinces to benefit from the President’s
      commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and as a result has
      developed its own low carbon use economic strategy. Reduction in carbon
      emissions through forest land conversion has figured prominently and is
      the reason for the Province to be a leading member of the Indonesian GCF
      program.</p><p>Forests continue to cover about 14.6 million ha out of an
      estimated original forest cover of 17.1 million ha. Of that remaining 5
      million ha are under conservation or protected status, including large and
      important national parks such as Kutai. While it appears that most
      converted forests within the national estate has already been incorporated
      in non- forest uses, the largest challenge facing the province is to
      contain forest degradation driven by encroachment and illegal logging and
      conflict over other resources such as illegal gold mining. The forests are
      essentially closed tropical humid forest with elevation, soils and
      rainfall, significant factors in determining variation in forest structure
      and species composition. East Kalimantan has extensive areas of delta
      (Mahakam River) with mangrove, Nipa and pandanus forests. Lateritic mid
      slope forests offer the highest proliferation of high value dipterocarp
      forest with some 267 species recognised. Limestone ridges and high
      mountains offer a range of forest communities of lower structure and high
      endemic diversity.</p><p>East Kalimantan has been selected as the focal
      province for Indonesia's efforts to reduce deforestation through the
      Forest Carbon Partnership Facility's Carbon Fund.  The province is working
      through close support from civil society and the private sector, which
      have joined with the government to launch a Green Growth Compact in
      2017.</p><p>Additional information can found on the <a

      <p>There is a need for analysis of current legal frameworks (national and
      regional) to address rights recognition (incorporating land and carbon
      ownerships rights) in particular as it relates to local and indigenous
      communities and regional and special autonomy laws.  This framework would
      need to be harmonized across provincial and central government regulations
      and ensure that communities and indigenous peoples properly benefit from
      REDD+ activities. Benefits need to be fair and ‘real’ (i.e. real impact on
      local community and standard of living) and a transparent mechanism for
      distribution needs to be achieved. Furthermore, work is needed to find
      mechanisms and pathways for communities to be more involved in early stage
      project development, not simply as project beneficiaries. This should go
      hand in hand with rights recognition of communities over forest areas.
      Finally, a recognised procedure is needed to be able to acknowledge
      rights, such as participatory mapping supported by legal mechanisms, e.g.
      Hutan Desa and other mechanisms (Gubernatorial / Regency Decrees,
      sub-national legal mechanisms). There are still many challenges to
      overcome community needs / rights and the central government land
      classification / designation.  REDD can be used to strengthen community
      and indigenous rights recognition.</p>

            <p>The implementation of Sustainable Production Forest Management
            (SFM) system has been started in Indonesia since the establishment
            of SFM-SFM Criteria and Indicators based on ITTO Guide Line since
            1997 (initially initiated by APHI, in collaboration with Forestry
            Faculties in Indonesia with further development bythe stipulation of
            Ministry of Forestry policy,SK.Menhut, No. 4795 / Kpts-II / 2002, on
            Criteria and Indicator of Sustainable Forest Management, followed by
            regulation of SK Dirjen BPK No. 42 / Kpts-Set / 2003 on Guidelines
            Technical Assessment of PHPL Performance by management unit
            Furthermore stipulation that Production Forest Management by license
            holder is "obligation - mandatory" hence developed policy of PHPL
            Performance Assessment is "Mandatory" which is last based on
            Kepmenhut Permen.LHK No. P.30 / Menlhk / Setjan / PHPL.3 / 3/2016,
            on Assessment of PHPL and VLK Performance on License Holder, Right

            no.P. 14 / PHPL / Set / 4/2016, tenthg Standards and Guidelines for
            Performance Assessment of PHPL and VLK.<br><br>At the same time
            developing a scheme of PHPL performance assessment under the FSC
            standard (as a Global Market requirement) is a "Voluntary"
            certification.Thus the practice of natural forest production is
            confronted with two "mandatory" and "option" certification
            schemes.Under these conditions, to accelerate the achievement of
            both forms of certification requires assistance from other
            institutions.In relation to the acceleration process the Pattern
            Partnership developed in achieving the two certification schemes.The
            partnership programs in the framework of certification achievements
            that have been and will continue to be developed in East Kalimantan
            are in two patterns: partnerships in the form of technical
            assistance and expertise (TNC-GIZ-WWF) and partnership pole in the
            Grant Funding aspect (The Borneo Initiative - TBI).This partnership
            pattern has been developed since 2005 in East
            Kalimantan.&nbsp;</p><p>Progress so far includes:</p><p>Implemented
            in the field by the committed IUPHHK-HA holder.It will continue to
