      <p>The Madre de Dios Region is located in the south-eastern part of the
      Peruvian territory, between parallels 9º 55'33 &quot;and 13º 20' 04&quot;,
      south latitude, and meridians 68º 39'27 &quot;and 77º 22 '27&quot;, west
      longitude . Its location is considered strategic because it constitutes a
      frontier region with the countries of Brazil and Bolivia.</p><p>It has a
      surface area of 85,182 square kilometers equivalent to 8,518,200 hectares,
      representing 6.6% of the national territory and 15.3% of the forest.
      Provinces in Madre de Dios include Tambopata (42.58% of the departmental
      area), Manu (32.54%) and Tahuamanu (24.88%).</p><p>It is mainly covered by
      subtropical forests where various productive activities are carried out,
      including the extraction of gold, wood and chestnuts. Recently the region
      has invested in ecotourism.</p><p>Throughout its history it has faced the
      restrictive problem of a lack of  communication and transportation
      infrastructure, which has isolated it from the rest of the country and
      limited economic development.</p><p>The region is endowed with a great
      potential in natural resources, and is considered the &quot;Peruvian
      capital of the biodiversity&quot;. There are three important protected
      areas: the Manu National Park, the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park and the
      Tambopata National Reserve.</p><p>Additional information can be found on

            Peru, the 3FI initiative is led by the Earth Innovation Institute
            and the Amazon Regional Council (CIAM, in Spanish) and is developing
            incentives for low-emission rural development under a production and
            protection approach. The activities of 3FI in the Peruvian Amazon
            are led by the regional governments and are open to the
            participation of any public or private institution that wishes to
            contribute. 3FI considers with special attention the participation
            of indigenous peoples and women in the activities to be carried out.
            The initiative is based on empowering the progress of each region to
            make the necessary incentives proposals by building tailored
            instruments for each jurisdiction. Output from the project include:
            (a) developing regional plans or roadmaps to promote a transition to
            low-emission rural development; (b) promoting a transparent dialogue
            process at the regional level which includes the perspectives of
            indigenous peoples and women; and (c) developing a business plan to
            attract private investment and promote low-emission rural
            development in the Peruvian Amazon.</p>

            ensuring land rights and forest native communities and agricultural
            and forestry producers; ii) optimizing the sustainable use of forest

            coordination by Amazon region, designing an architecture of
            financing, increasing the productivity of agricultural crops and
