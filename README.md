# Forest Database

This is a proposed redo of an existing website. The existing website displays data for member jurisdictions as well as for the nation to which they belong. The general term "jurisdiction" is used because nations can refer to their subunits as either "states" or "provinces".

The displayed fields can thus be categorized as either "national" or "jurisdictional". The [field definitions](config/field-defs.yml) are thus grouped by these two categories.
